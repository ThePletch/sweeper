# Channel Sweeper

A simple discord bot that sweeps discussions to another channel while providing a link between the discussions for continuity.

MVP features still to add:
* RBAC (so servers can make the sweep command restricted to certain user groups)
* Error handling for trying to sweep into channels the bot can't see
